flagging has some issue -> all dependencies get flagged as 1 and they do not increase above 1.

insertion of dict items doesnt work in report generation
should work as follows: %(dict_key)s will be replaced with value: "dict_key": dict_value
-> doesnt work at all but no error

testing using: python  main.py -f "ipynb" -a submissions_A3.zip -c True  -an TEST -cn TEST2
